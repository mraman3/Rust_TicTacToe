## About The Project
This is my first-ever attempt at programming with rust and I have decided to pursue a simple tic-tac-toe project. 

The UI is terminal this was done so purposely as I intended to implement Iroh a p2p networking in an attempt to make the game online. With maybe 
later adding a fun and interactive GUI. My first goal is to learn the basics of Rust and I feel I have done so with adequate Unit tests, functions,
documentation, and other aspects of Rust that I am new to.
